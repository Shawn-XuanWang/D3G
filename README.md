# D3G

## Overview
Distributed Differentiable Dynamic Game (D3G) is a framework, which enables learning multirobot coordination from demonstrations. We employ two types
of robots and two scenarios to validate Algorithms.
1. XEn.py uses a planar quadrotor model as robot dynamics, and define the cost function of different scenarios mentioned above.
2. GEn.py uses a unicyle model as robot dynamics, and define the cost function of different scenarios mentioned above.
3. GPDP.py implements the distributed game solver and the distributed differentiable Pontryaginâ€™s Minimum Principle (PMP) solver algorithms.

## Usage

### Getting started

Download the source code folder and establish new projects in Pycharm (recommended). Make sure all associated files are properly linked to the project.

Requirements:

Python 3.10 tested

numpy 1.23.2 tested

casadi 3.5.5.post2 tested

matplotlib 3.5.3 tested

### The scenarios
The package contains three folers named as "". Each foler is corresponding to one specific sceario. In each folder, `generate_demo.py` is to generate a demonstration, and `formation_learning.py` is for learning from the demonstration. For each scenario, first run `generate_demo.py` to generate a dataset of demonstration which will be saved in the 'data' foler. Then run `formation_learning.py` to learn the demonstration.

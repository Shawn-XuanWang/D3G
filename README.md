# D3G

## Overview
Distributed Differentiable Dynamic Game (D3G) is a framework, which enables learning multirobot coordination from demonstrations. We employ two types
of robots and two scenarios to validate Algorithms.
1. XEn.py uses a planar quadrotor model as robot dynamics, and define the cost function of different scenarios mentioned above.
2. GEn.py uses a unicyle model as robot dynamics, and define the cost function of different scenarios mentioned above.
3. GPDP.py implement the distributed game solver and the distributed differentiable Pontryaginâ€™s Minimum Principle (PMP) solver algorithms.
